[00:07.95] Southern fist
[00:09.98] Rise through tha jungle mist
[00:11.35] Clenched to smash power so cancerous
[00:13.39] A black flag and a red star
[00:15.12] A rising sun loomin' over Los Angeles
[00:18.09] Yes for raza livin in la la
[00:20.54] Is like gaza on to tha dawn of intifada
[00:23.18] Reach for tha lessons tha masked pass on
[00:25.25] And seize tha metropolis
[00:26.83] It's you that it's built on
[00:40.33] 
[00:28.07] Everything can change on a new years day
[00:32.37] Everything can change on a new years day
[00:36.96] Everything can change on a new years day
[00:41.46] As everything changed on a new years day, come on
[01:05.96] 
[00:46.67] War within a breath
[00:48.95] It's land or death
[00:51.27] War within a breath
[00:53.22] It's land or death
[00:55.70] War within a breath
[00:58.03] It's land or death
[01:00.26] War within a breath
[01:09.76] 
[01:13.25] Shots heard underground round tha rapture
[01:15.78] Tha world's eye captured
[01:16.93] At last in a Mexican pasture
[01:18.22] Tha masked screaming land or death
[01:20.24] Within a breath
[01:21.11] A war from tha depth of time
[01:22.48] Who shot four puppet governors in a line
[01:24.48] All the world bankers
[01:26.03] Who think they can rhyme
[01:27.24] Shot tha landlords who knew it was mine
[01:29.33] Yes, it's a war from tha depth of time
[01:48.33] 
[01:31.62] Everything can change on a new years day
[01:36.40] As everything can change on a new years day
[01:40.92] Everything can change on a new years day
[01:45.53] As everything can change on a new years day, come on
[02:11.53] 
[01:53.48] Oh, hear the masked scream
[01:55.86] War within a breath
[01:57.53] It's land or death
[02:00.03] War within a breath
[02:02.39] It's land or death
[02:04.59] War within a breath
[02:06.50] It's land or death
[02:08.84] War within a breath
[02:11.26] It's land or death
[02:20.26]

[02:38.59] 
[02:45.93] It's war within a breath
[02:49.08] It's land or death
[02:51.49] War within a breath
[02:53.56] It's land or death
[02:55.83] War within a breath
[02:57.84] It's land or death
[02:59.94] War within a breath
[03:02.27] It's land or death
[03:04.36] War within a breath
